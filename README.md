# Rusty Adventure Treasure Hunt

# Overview

Rusty Adventure is not only a treasure hunt but an adventure into the language of Rust.
This game will take users through a text-based adventure where they will encounter
scenarios that will ask for their input and relay the consequences (whether they be good or bad)
in the end. This program helped me gain a stronger understanding of Rust and what it is
capable of.
